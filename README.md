# fsipleiria-ros

## Requirements

### Hardware 

- A 32 or 64-bit computer.
- A microcontroller (Arduino, ARM Mbed, or Tiva-C Launchpads).
- USB or ethernet link between the computer and the microcontroller.

### Software

- Operating system: Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal)
- ROS Noetic Ninjemys
    - rosservice

## Setup

- Install Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal) on the machine (Either Desktop or Core version. Core is CLI, but has better performance. Can't use ROS 2D/3D visualization). The process is very straightforward and is like installing any other OS.
- Install ROS Noetic Ninjemys. Process described here: http://wiki.ros.org/noetic/Installation/Ubuntu.
